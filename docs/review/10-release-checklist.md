# Release Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist defines the release flow for LECG Revit 2026 after CI hardening and version centralization.

## Preconditions

- `main` branch protection is active.
- Required checks are green:
  - `core-tests`
  - `plugin-build`
- Version metadata is managed in `Directory.Build.props`.

## Release Steps

1. Update `VersionPrefix` in `Directory.Build.props` (for example `0.1.0` -> `0.1.1`).
2. Validate locally:
   - `dotnet build -c Debug`
   - `dotnet test`
3. Open and merge a PR with the version bump.
4. Confirm CI checks pass on `main`.
5. Create and push a tag using `vX.Y.Z` format.
6. Verify `release.yml` creates a GitHub Release with autogenerated notes.
7. Verify release artifacts and release notes content.
8. Record release summary in `docs/review/08-quality-report.md`.

## Tagging Convention

- Stable release: `vX.Y.Z`
- Pre-release: `vX.Y.Z-rcN`

## Rollback

If a release is invalid:

1. Remove or mark the GitHub Release as draft/obsolete.
2. Create a fix PR on `main`.
3. Publish a new patch tag with corrected version.
