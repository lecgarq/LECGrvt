PLEASE READ: Icon Generation Failed

Due to high demand on the AI image generation service, the "Nano Banana Pro" icons could not be automatically generated.
Currently, the icons are yellow square placeholders.

To replace them with your own icons:
1. Create or find PNG images (recommended 32x32 pixels or 64x64 for high DPI).
2. Name them exactly as follows:
   - Home.png
   - ResetSlabs.png
   - OffsetElevations.png
   - AssignMaterial.png
   - CleanSchemas.png
   - Purge.png
   - SexyRevit.png
   - RenderMatch.png
   - SearchReplace.png
3. Overwrite the files in this folder with your new images.
4. Rebuild the project (dotnet build).

The yellow squares will be replaced by your new icons.
